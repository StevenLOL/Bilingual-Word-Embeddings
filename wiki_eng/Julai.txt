A thug named Bittu (Sonu Sood) and a local MLA Varadarajulu (Kota Srinivasa Rao) plan to rob ₹15 billion (US$230 million) (₹1500 crore) from a bank. Ravindra Narayan a.k.a. Ravi (Allu Arjun) believes in earning quick money rather than toiling like his father Narayana Moorti (Tanikella Bharani). During a chance meeting with Bittu, Ravi reveals his intention of making quick money by betting on an IPL match and discloses the location of the betting ring. However, the police raid the location and Ravi is apprehended. During interrogation, Ravi deduces that Bittu has tipped off the Police to commit a crime and attempts to convince the ACP Raja Manikyam (Rao Ramesh). Bittu successfully robs the bank and his brother Laala (Shafi) takes the money to the city's dumping yard. However, the Police catches Lala, who resists them only to be killed by Ravi. Meanwhile, Bittu goes to the dumping yard to collect the money, but is shocked as the dumping yard is burnt to ashes. Having his brother dead and the money burnt, Bittu decides to kill Ravi. Raja Manikyam sends Ravi to Hyderabad from Visakhapatnam under the Witness Protection Program and makes him to stay at his friend ACP Sitaram (Rajendra Prasad)'s house. One day, Ravi happens to see Madhu (Ileana), a middle class girl who works with travel agent Travel Moorthi (Brahmaji), an associate of Bittu. He prepares fake passports for Bittu's gang to help them escape from India. Ravi befriends Madhu and both fall in love with each other, and the two find out about Bittu.
Eventually a final showdown between Ravi and Bittu occurs wherein both intend to end the other.

In 2010 after his film Khaleja was released, many reports suggested that Trivikram would work with Venkatesh for his next film.[9] It was reported that the film would start filming in Early 2011.[10] But due to unknown reasons, the project failed to take off. In March 2011, reports suggested that Trivikram had approached Allu Arjun for a film and that Arjun has accepted the offer.[11] Also it was reported that DVV Danayya would produce the film under his Universal Media banner.[12] DVV Danayya previously made the successful film Desamuduru with Allu Arjun.[13] It was also reported that Ileana was cast as the female lead and the filming would begin in May 2011.[14] Although there were several reports on when the filming would begin, all proved untrue. In August 2011, it was reported that Allu Arjun has injured his shoulder and went to Australia for surgery on Trivikram's request. This caused the project to be further delayed.[15] In September 2011, an official statement was released by the producers stating that as Allu Arjun was in Australia for shoulder surgery, the filming would start in late October 2011. It was also announced that the film is being produced by S. Radha Krishna under his Haarika & Hassine banner and with DVV Danayya presenting it.[16] It was also announced that Devi Sri Prasad who had previously worked with both Arjun and Trivikram would score the music. It was reported that both Allu Arjun as well as Trivikram had slashed their remuneration for the film in a bid to bring the production cost down. Finally on 2 November 2011 after months of getting delayed the film was officially launched. It was announced that Ileana was cast as the female lead and the other cast and crew was also announced.

The other cast includes popular Telugu actors like Kota Srinivasa Rao, Brahmanandam, Tanikella Bharani, M. S. Narayana, Dharmavarapu Subramanyam, Brahmaji and Rao Ramesh. It was reported that Mahesh Babu would provide voice over for the film similar to Trivikram's Jalsa, but it proved to be untrue.

Julayi received extremely high positive reviews from critics praising the performances of Allu Arjun and Sonu Sood . Riya Chakravarty from NDTV wrote, "Overall, the movie caters to all ages. Watch the movie for its witty dialogues and energetic performances.".[35] Sangeetha Devi Dundoo from The Hindu described the film as "high on energy and wit" and commented that "Julayi has all the staple ingredients that characterise a Telugu masala entertainer" and concluded that "brain matches brawn in this masala entertainer".[36] Shekhar from OneIndia Entertainment in a positive review concluded, "Watch Julayi for Allu Arjun's energetic performance, Devi Sri Prasad's music, Trivikram's witty dialogues, Sonu Sood's great action, Rajendra Prasad's performance and Ileana's glamour. It is a perfect mixture of performances. The film has everything for the audience of all class and age group." Akshath Anoop stated "Well, considering the fact that the film is one of the best I've seen, and it could have added more tricks of Allu Arjun's character's "Logic", The film is overall great. Arjun's and Sood's performance especially receives attention because to me, they have performed the best. Ileana d'cruz had also presented herself well but there were possibilities she could have improved. As I said, the film could have added more of the LOGIC theme because the whole character of Allu Arjun runs on it and so does the enjoyment of the audience. So don't have second thoughts before entering the theatre and just run in, 'cause what's waiting for you inside is something unbelievable" and gave it 4.5/5 stars.[37]
Karthik Pasupulate from The Times of India gave the film three out of five stars and commented that "The movie has enough in it for Allu Arjun fans to dig into it, the others might not find it as amusing."[38] Pavithra Srinivasan from Rediff criticised the film and felt it to be a "no brainer which loses steam because of the glaring lack of logic" and "gaping plot-holes". She lauded Allu Arjun for "carrying the film on his capable shoulders, hurling punches (both verbal and physical), bashing up goons and going gaga for his girl."[39] CNN-IBN declared the film as "lackluster" and noted that the film was "more amusing than intelligent". It also felt that the film is "far from being either a romance or a laugh riot."[40]
